# FFmpeg

This script is made to compile FFmpeg with common codecs on Linux and macOS.

## Looking for the pre-compiled result?

Check out the [build server](https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de). Here you can download builds for Linux and macOS.

## Branches

The `main` branch contains the latest stable script used for release builds (e.g. version 8.0). The `develop` branch contains the latest changes and used for snapshot builds.

To get a full list of all formats and codecs that are supported just execute
```
./ffmpeg -formats
./ffmpeg -codecs
./ffmpeg -protocols
```

## Requirements

There are just a few dependencies to other tools. Most of the software is compiled or downloaded during script execution. Also most of the tools should be already available on the system by default.

### Linux

- gcc (c and c++ compiler)
- curl
- make
- zip, bunzip2
- rust / cargo / cargo-c
- python3 (including pip virtualenv)

### macOS

- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835)
- rust / cargo / cargo-c
- python3 (including pip virtualenv)

### Windows (not supported)

For compilation on Windows please use `MSYS2`. Follow the whole instructions for installation (including step 7).
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

## Execution

All files that are downloaded and generated through this script are placed in the current working directory. The recommendation is to use an empty folder for this and execute the `build.sh`.
```sh
mkdir ffmpeg-compile
cd ffmpeg-compile
../build.sh
```

You can use the following parameters
- `-FFMPEG_SNAPSHOT=YES` for using the latest snapshot of FFmpeg instead of the last release
- `-SKIP_TEST=YES` for skipping the tests after compiling
- `-SKIP_BUNDLE=YES` for skipping creating the `ffmpeg-success.zip` file
- `-CPU_LIMIT=num` for limit CPU thread usage (default: automatically detected)

If you don't need a codec/library, you can also disable them:
- libraries
    - `-SKIP_LIBKLVANC=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBBLURAY=YES`
    - `-SKIP_SNAPPY=YES`
    - `-SKIP_SRT=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBVMAF=YES`
    - `-SKIP_ZIMG=YES`
    - `-SKIP_ZVBI=YES`
- video codecs
    - `-SKIP_AOM=YES`
    - `-SKIP_DAV1D=YES`
    - `-SKIP_OPEN_H264=YES`
    - `-SKIP_OPEN_JPEG=YES`
    - `-SKIP_RAV1E=YES`
    - `-SKIP_SVT_AV1=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBTHEORA=YES`
    - `-SKIP_VPX=YES`
    - `-SKIP_VVENC=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBWEBP=YES`
    - `-SKIP_X264=YES`
    - `-SKIP_X265=YES`
    - `-SKIP_X265_MULTIBIT=YES`
- audio codecs
    - `-SKIP_LAME=YES`
    - `-SKIP_OPUS=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBVORBIS=YES`

After the execution a new folder called `out` exists. It contains the compiled FFmpeg binary (in the `bin` sub-folder).
The `ffmpeg-success.zip` contains also all binary files of FFmpeg, FFprobe and FFplay.

### Decklink

It is required to prepare the Blackmagic Decklink SDK manually, because a automated download is not possible.
Download the SDK manually from the [Blackmagic Website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/) and extract the compressed file.
Then add the following parameters (for the SDK include location):
```sh
-DECKLINK_SDK=/path/to/SDK/os/include -SKIP_DECKLINK=NO
```

## Validate Build

### Dynamic Linking

You can check dynamically linked libraries using the following command:
```
# macOS
otool -L out/bin/ffmpeg

# linux
ldd out/bin/ffmpeg
```

## Build failed?

Check the detailed logfiles in the `log` directory. Each build step has its own file starting with "build-*".

If the build of ffmpeg fails during the configuration phase (e.g. because it doesn't find one codec) check also the log file in `source/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-*/ffbuild/config.log`.
